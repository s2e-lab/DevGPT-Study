# Start the conversation
print("Hello! I'm here to help you find great movies to watch.")
user_input = input("Please enter the name of a film you enjoyed recently: ")

# You would then process the user input, gather additional information, and generate recommendations based on the user's preferences.
# This would involve using your AI model, database of movies, and recommendation logic.

# Finally, you would present the recommendations to the user and ask for feedback and additional preferences.
# The conversation flow would continue based on the user's responses.
